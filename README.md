### Hi there 👋
If you are looking for an Elasticsearch Expert, look no further. I am the first Elastic Certified Professional of the Year in the EMEA region [See the award honoree page](https://www.elastic.co/events/awards/winners) for the credentials and video.

I am building API's, search integrations while using Elasticsearch and Laravel.com. If you need help on either of those do contact me.
